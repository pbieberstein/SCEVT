SCEVT is a tool to easily visualize and analyze scaffolds during de-novo genome assembly.

Here is an sample output from the scaff_to_scaff_vis.py script which takes two scaffolds sequences and BLAT gene mappings,
and then visualizes the gaps in the scaffolds (in red), the unique genes on the scaffolds (in green) and the genes that are present
on both scaffolds (in purple)

Eventually, you can expect plots like this:

#### Currently still in development:
Progress:
* scaff_to_scaff_vis.py script is DONE ![#c5f015](https://placehold.it/15/c5f015/000000?text=+)
* gene_vis.py script is currently being worked on ![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+)
* snp_vis.py has not been started yet ![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+)
